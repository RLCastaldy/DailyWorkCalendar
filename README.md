# DailyWorkCalendar<br>
<br>

This calendar app is designed to help keep the typical work day organized. With the ability to save text for any hour from 9am to 5pm, you will never miss another important appointment. Simply click on the text field that corresponds with the time of day your obligation will take place. From there, simply type a message to describe the event. Once finished, hit the save button to the right of the text field to save the data. When you come back to the app, the data will be saved and you can easily maintain your schedule. As the day progresses, each time slot will change colors depending on whether that time has passed, is the current time, or has yet to arrive. You will never have to worry again with the use of the Daily Work Calendar!<br>
